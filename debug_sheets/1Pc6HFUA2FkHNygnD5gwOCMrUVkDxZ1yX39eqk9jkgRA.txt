# Servant Profile

 Personality \[edit\] ...Saber is a quiet man. Which is a rather nice way to phrase things. An air of doom and gloom seems to accompany him wherever he goes. After all, it is difficult for any cheerfulness to survive in the presence of someone who has watched, with his own eyes, how the so-called divine teachings of Galen crumbled beneath his own scalpel and pen. From that moment onwards, he regarded all forms of worship as nothing more than a layer of veneer painted over ignorance. ...On that note, Saber is also a pragmatic man. Realism forms the foundation of his worldview. Earth is the cradle from which all knowledge rises. The flesh it births is the raw material of his life's work. Thus, he places the utmost trust in only what his eyes can see, what his hands can touch, and what his mind can resonate with. Though that last part doesn't happen very often. ...But Saber does make it quite obvious, his contempt for heroes and their equally heroic acts. His temperament teeters at extremes. He is reticent and austere. Despondent, yet quietly proud. In conversations, he rarely offers up heartfelt praises and instead fixates on faults so minor that surely no one would notice, because he claims to not possess a heart and thus behaves accordingly. Should one bite back, however, Saber will then fall into one of two predictable behaviors: either double down with increasingly harsh words until his opponent is flayed by his tongue OR, on the rare occasion that one's argument is utterly flawless, retreat into a corner to sulk in silence while filling pages upon pages with sketches of whatever catches his fancy. ...These volatile reactions, however, are reserved for *humans* alone. Toward *inhuman beings*, Saber only shows a mild, dispassionate interest, the same way a scholar might tolerate having a specimen placed upon his desk. In a sense, this actually makes him more pleasant to work with. ...At the end of the day, only Saber knows what's going through that pretty head of his. Appearance \[edit\] Saber's skin is a pallid white often seen on someone who has spent years away from the sun. So thin and delicate is it that, upon closer inspection, one could easily make out faint blue veins pulsing just beneath the surface. Yet this almost sickly complexion is stretched over a frame of `immaculate proportions;` a balanced, androgynous, and unnervingly perfect frame in the distribution of musculature and bone... Just like a doll brought to life. A head of black hair carelessly frames his face, with stray strands perpetually falling in front of his equally black eyes (someone please lend him a hairbrush). The same color scheme is reflected in his outfit as well, as Saber favors monochromatic pieces often made of velvet, lace, and other sheer fabrics. Weapons \[edit\] Anguis While not a weapon in the combative sense, Anguis is an indispensable part of Saber and perhaps the only reason he is able to fight the way he does. From the outset, Anguis appears as a snake that's always seen coiled on some parts of Saber's body, clothes, or weapons. It does not speak, though is prone to conveying its thoughts via the occasional nod or shake of its head. Twin Blades / 'The Instrument' The default state of Saber's [`secondary Noble Phantasm`](). Saber can summon and unsummon it at will. Parameters \[edit\] STR D Saber has no notable feats of martial prowess to speak of. He is a scholar through and through. While dissection in the Renaissance era was a physically demanding endeavor, it had more to do with stamina rather than raw muscular strength. As such, his STR is modest, though it is sufficient for small-scale combat. END B On his own, Saber's natural resilience is nothing to write home about, aside from perhaps a higher-than-average stamina developed through years of anatomical work. However, due to the effects of his [`Personal Skill`](#bookmark=id.dilsahcxd99e), his self-restorative capability is-for lack of a better term-absolutely bonkers. Thus, his END is effectively elevated to B rank. Without the Skill, his END would rank closer to C. In short, Saber is fairly easy to injure, but rather annoying to annihilate...unless one diligently plays by his rules. AGL B Saber's AGI is indicative of his extraordinarily fine motor control, reaction speed, and precision with the hands while handling blades and instruments of all shapes and sizes. These are traits honed through a lifetime of surgical practices that often included the delicate task of peeling nerves and blood vessels from the human body. While not a renowned swordsman, his dexterity more than makes up for his lack of formal training and results in a rather refreshing fighting style. In terms of raw speed, however, Saber is much less impressive, being comparable to other Servants with a similar background: that of being human, and with only the typical amount of physical conditioning. Unless an opposing Servant is known for being slow or frail OR has a decidedly inferior rank in AGI (E, or D in some cases), Saber would struggle to outpace anyone coming from a militaristic or physically demanding background. MP B While not a magus himself, Saber still boasts respectable mana reserves, both thanks to the transitional era he hails from where Mystery still retained considerable strength, as well as his ability to replenish mana via his [`Personal Skill`](#bookmark=id.d09dise9k9cp). LUK C Saber's life was marked by both great fortune and terrible misfortune. Though he rose to prominent positions in both academia and court and reshaped the course of European medical practices, his life was also hounded by slander and controversy both religious and political, which eventually resulted in his tragic death. Thus, his LUK sits at a rather middling rank. Andreas Vesalius Artist Credit Moi\!

# Backstory

 Backstory \[edit\] Honestly, there's not much to say. This here is just a man with a bit of obsession doing what people without it cannot. His name was Andreas Vesalius. He lived in Europe some five hundred years ago. Back then, the medical world treated the words of a fellow named Galen-who lived well over a thousand years before then, mind you-as the gospel. If those ancient tomes declared the human jaw was made of a single bone, then, heavens, it *was* a single bone. Even if you could feel with your own hands that it was obviously two, well...clearly *you* were the one who was wrong. Vesalius found that a bit silly. So he decided to do some fact-checking of his own. He started dissecting bodies layer by layer. But there are only so many layers one can peel from a single corpse. Where, then, was a young anatomist supposed to procure more subjects *legally?* The short answer is: he couldn't. The long answer is: he didn't let that stop him. Thus, most of his 'research materials' were procured from gallows in the dead of night or dug up from graveyards. Using methods that would qualify as crimes both then and now, he pieced together the first true atlas of the human body and showed the world what it actually looked like. He then illustrated everything in painstaking detail and wrote a book. When the book was published, it effectively shattered a millennium-old shrine overnight. Vesalius pointed to his diagrams and proudly told everyone who would listen, 'Look\! We've been wrong this whole time.' One cannot begin to imagine the number of toes he managed to step on. The Church was thoroughly offended. It accused him of vivisection and came dangerously close to having him executed. Eventually, he set out on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and, on the way back, suffered a shipwreck and died on a lonely island, miles and miles away from the world he'd changed. And that, more or less, is his story. ✦ [PROFILE]() . . . ✦ [BACKSTORY]() . . . ✦ NOBLE PHANTASM [Non Omnis Moriar]() [Memento Mori\!]() . . . ✦ [CLASS SKILLS]() . . . ✦ [PERSONAL SKILLS]() . . . ✦ [GALLERY]() . . . ✦ [TRIVIA]()

# Non Omnis Moriar (NP1)

 Instrument of Immortality Non Omnis Moriar Rank : B Type : Anti-Man Range : 1-10m Targets : 1 *-So long as it's made of flesh and blood, anything can be cut.* A vessel of the soul. A temple for the gods. The splitting image of deities that governed the world. From the earliest recorded papyri to the great anatomical treatises of the Renaissance period, the human body has been revered as more than mere flesh. Its structure was considered sanctified, its status elevated high above those of other species, and thus even the medical practices meant to understand it were conducted under a spiritual lens. In an age where anatomy was deemed taboo, dissection became a sacrilegious act that was believed to sever one's path to the afterlife... ...Until someone dared to break the monopoly the gods held over the human body and turn the flesh into a readable book. The adoption of human dissections as a routine part of medical studies. The shift towards firsthand observations over the reliance on ancient texts. Saber, in his fixation over the human body, introduced many unprecedented practices that ended an ancient Mystery upheld since the Age of Gods and began a modern Mystery sustained by humanity's belief in itself. Thus, *Non Omnis Moriar* embodies the conceptual weight behind perhaps the oldest and most iconic symbol of medical science: the `surgical scalpel,` and derives its strength from the continuation of Human Order. In extremely rare circumstances\*\*, its effectiveness can even rival relics from ancient times. Effects *Non Omnis Moriar* manifests as a pair of beautiful twin blades. While already displaying an unusual degree of *sharpness* and the ability to *cut* in its neutral state, the blades' strength truly shines when used against anything that can be conceptually defined as 'flesh.' In such cases, they *bypass physical and thaumaturgical defenses of the target upon direct, physical contact* and are able to damage their internal systems with surgical precision. While under the influence of [`Praesente Medico Nihil Nocet`](#bookmark=id.dilsahcxd99e) and fused with [`Anguis`](#bookmark=id.3ym7t8pv5t5)`,` the blades- Gain the ability to transform into a slew of medical instruments such as a knife, a saw, a pair of forceps, a nail, needles and threads, etc. Moreover, each of these instruments, as well as each *type* of these instruments that aren't necessarily created by Saber himself, is treated as a `'sword'` in Saber's hands, which allows him to benefit from his Class Container and wield them with utmost proficiency. Allow Saber to expedite the healing of injuries *on others* that would normally be manageable through surgical interventions, such as lacerations, fractures, and severed tissues, so long as he is using the NP for treatment purposes. Limitations & Ruling On 'Flesh': This includes anything with a *defined and materialized* internal structure that *resembles or mimics* biological organs, circuits, muscles, nerves, blood vessels, joints, etc. Even more so if the target possesses vital cores such as a heart or a brain. The effect is not applicable to targets that lack biological or conceptually biological structures, such as purely mechanical constructs, golems or familiars of an inorganic make, or entities of an incorporeal nature. On Healing: *Non Omnis Moriar* cannot heal mortal wounds, regenerate lost organs, or mitigate thaumaturgical debilitations that do not correspond to a treatable physical injury. Diseases or poisons cannot be cured, though their symptoms can be alleviated while waiting for other methods of treatment. Treatment also requires *time* proportional to the injury's severity and thus cannot be used instantaneously during high-speed combat. On 'Extremely Rare Circumstances': This is subject to discussion with the relevant players IRP. Though, in broad strokes, the NP would naturally become stronger while in the vicinity of medical or healing facilities, when used against abilities that reinforce concepts such as 'a perfect/inviolable body,' when used to exploit weaknesses *of* the body, or when used to combat Mysteries that medicine has historically triumphed over. Examples of Power Saber prods Karna with his sword. The sword goes through his invincistructable armor and cuts him oh my. Saber prods Mecha Liz with his sword. The sword bounces off. Mecha Liz is mad\! And folds Saber in two. ✦ [PROFILE]() . . . ✦ [BACKSTORY]() . . . ✦ NOBLE PHANTASM [Non Omnis Moriar]() [Memento Mori\!]() . . . ✦ [CLASS SKILLS]() . . . ✦ [PERSONAL SKILLS]() . . . ✦ [GALLERY]() . . . ✦ [TRIVIA]()

# Memento Mori\! (NP2)

 Tribunal of Life and Death Memento Mori\! Rank : A Type : Reality Marble Range : 50m Targets : 1-250 *-All who enter must do so with reverence in their hearts.* An [`Anatomical Theatre`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_theatre) is an auditorium with a tiered circular structure surrounding a central operating table, where people can watch dissections of cadavers from the levels above. It was the first officiated place in Western history where death was put on public display and studied before a mass audience. Within the Theatre, anatomical dissections were performed like sacred rituals. Normally, a clergy would oversee the proceedings, while medical officials maintained decorum. Candles and incense were also used to dispel the cadaver's smell, as well as add to the sanctity of the event. Last but not least, a large number of witnesses are gathered within the theatre to satisfy their own curiosities. Some treated the event as a public spectacle. Others treated it as a ceremony or an educational course. The Theatre itself fulfils a multitude of purposes for this very reason, serving as a lecture hall, a chapel, a mortuary, and a courtroom all in one. It is a space where one confronts their own mortality, either as a witness, or as the one on the operating table. ...Please, do not gaze upon this theatre with trepidation; for even death deserves to be sung in beauty. Effects *Memento Mori\!* manifests as a grand Anatomical Theatre that is ornate in decor and chilling in atmosphere. Its architecture is classical yet grotesque; it is solemn as a courtroom, yet sacred as a baptism font. It is where Saber's belief was shattered and rebuilt. It is where the world's truth became his truth. The Theatre is his reality: It is the shape of his soul. Upon True Name Release, up to 250 individuals within a 50 meter radius are captured and taken inside. Within the Theatre, all but one of the individuals assume the role of `audience members` that occupy the various levels of the observation balconies, while the chosen individual assumes the role of the `cadaver.` Saber: Saber is able to manifest an arbitrary number of medical instruments under *Non Omnis Moriar* within the Theatre's walls. 'The Theatre': The Theatre's internal size fluctuates to match the number of individuals captured within. It does not sustain any structural damage so long as the Noble Phantasm itself is not broken. 'The Audience': Cannot interfere with the events occurring at the operating table. Cannot interact with Saber or the individual designated as the cadaver. Cannot commit acts of violence. Cannot emit sounds above the level of a soft whisper. Any violation of the above rules results in instant ejection from the Theatre. 'The Cadaver': The individual designated as the cadaver cannot escape the confines of the Theatre on their own, unless Saber releases them, the Noble Phantasm ends or is forcibly broken. They also cannot interact with the audience. Within the Theatre, each strike from Saber to this individual takes on a *paralytic effect* that is akin to injecting the target with a potent dose of anaesthesia. Those with Magic Resistance can mitigate this influence to a degree, but *repeated exposure* to Saber's weapon, as well as prolonged *time spent inside the Theatre* after being struck even once will steadily erode the target's ability to resist. Once the target has fully succumbed, they are then regarded as a proper corpse and become completely docile in Saber's hands. At that point, Saber is able to selectively excise, then preserve parts of their form as `specimens` and display them inside the theatre for eternity... It is important to note that within the Reality Marble, even abstract concepts such as `the mind`, `consciousness`, `memories`, `statuses`, or even `personalities` that make up aspects of the self can be treated by Saber as tangible objects. Not only can they be observed, but they can also be dissected, catalogued, and immortalized by Saber's hands. The operation will not begin until the target has been completely subdued. After the target is released, they will not be able to regain whatever portions of themselves were left behind in the Theatre. Limitations & Ruling On Paralysis: The length of time, or the number of attacks that need to be sustained can be discussed with the relevant player beforehand. Of course, due to the narrative-heavy nature of this NP, even the method of entry, exit, and the operation itself are things that can be up for discussion. On Duration: Likewise, while typically the NP allows adequate time for Saber to subdue and complete one full operation on the target, the duration can be adjusted for narrative purposes with the affected player's consent. Examples of Power Saber's Master is under attack\! Saber activates the NP and places both his Master and the enemy in quarantine. The enemy still attempts to attack and gets ejected from the Theatre for bad behavior. Saber's Master is safe\! Saber's Master had a really bad dream\! Saber activates the NP and excises memories of the bad dream from them. The Master is no longer distressed\! ✦ [PROFILE]() . . . ✦ [BACKSTORY]() . . . ✦ NOBLE PHANTASM [Non Omnis Moriar]() [Memento Mori\!]() . . . ✦ [CLASS SKILLS]() . . . ✦ [PERSONAL SKILLS]() . . . ✦ [GALLERY]() . . . ✦ [TRIVIA]()

# Class Skills

 Magic Resistance Rank : C A conditional Magic Resistance bestowed upon Saber due to his feats of challenging the long-held superstitions regarding the sanctity of the human body and his dismantling of Mystery surrounding it. Any magecraft that can be categorized, dissected, studied, and ultimately understood gradually loses effectiveness when repeatedly cast upon him. The more Saber is exposed to the same spell, the more he grasps its 'anatomy.' Each subsequent exposure further reduces the spell's severity or duration, delays any timed effects, or eases the conditions required to mitigate it. However, he cannot achieve total immunity to large-scale, high-tier, or conceptual magecraft that bypasses Magic Resistance. Nor can he affect spells that do not target him directly (e.g. AOE effects). Riding Rank : D *(While this skill would normally be given a rank of E+, within the setting of /Starry Night it is elevated to the rank of D.)* A perfunctory skill granted by the Saber class container. Saber possesses no historical feats related to mounted combat. Thus, he does not exhibit any notable talents for riding. However, as a Renaissance physician who frequently traveled between cities for lectures, dissections, and court summons, he is reasonably capable of handling ordinary mounts and vehicles when it is done for the sake of escorting a patient, a student, or, in the context of a Holy Grail War, a Master. In such circumstances, his Riding subtly improves. On the other hand, Saber is completely incapable of operating ships or other nautical vessels, due to the circumstances surrounding his exile and death during a particularly disastrous voyage at sea. ✦ [PROFILE]() . . . ✦ [BACKSTORY]() . . . ✦ NOBLE PHANTASM [Non Omnis Moriar]() [Memento Mori\!]() . . . ✦ [CLASS SKILLS]() . . . ✦ [PERSONAL SKILLS]() . . . ✦ [GALLERY]() . . . ✦ [TRIVIA]()

# Personal Skills

 Totius Europae Praeceptor Rank : B *`The teacher of all Europe.`* As the one who debunked the anatomical teachings of Galen, which had been widely accepted as *the* authoritative source for human studies for nearly 1500 years prior to his time, Saber managed to codify the structure of the human body in unprecedented detail. As the author of the groundbreaking book on human anatomy, *De Humani Corporis Fabrica,* he possesses an incredibly heightened instinct for identifying anatomical weaknesses in humanoid opponents. Additionally, having worked as a renowned professor at the then-medical-center of Europe and served as the court physician to both Emperor Charles V and King Philip II, allies who share royal blood or have served within a royal court can share the benefit of this skill in Saber's vicinity. Examples of Power Saber cuts humanoids good. It's pretty self-explanatory. Cessante Causa Cessat Effectus Rank : B *`When the cause ceases, the effect also ceases.`* A skill born from the darker legends that surrounded Saber throughout his life. While no doubt a pioneer that contributed substantially to the advancement of medical science, the deeds he had undertaken for that purpose often branded him in rumors such as grave robbing and corpse plundering. Whispers of him being a blasphemer who trespassed upon taboos meant for priests and gods followed him wherever he went. In the centuries that followed, wildly embellished tales cast him as a man who tangled, perhaps too intimately, with death itself. They depicted him as a disillusioned warrior who'd lost his purpose, ultimately cast into exile and met a tragic end in a foreign land. Unable to fulfill his lifelong wish, Saber's soul grew hard and defiant toward fate. His wrath burns irrationally and undyingly, even when summoned as a Saber class Servant. Effects Grants Saber an extremely high affinity towards spirits and the dead, not only allowing him an easier time to track them down and vice versa, but also allows him to use such beings to replenish his magical energy. At the same time, the consumption of such beings may intensify his obsession and `madness`, causing him to succumb to the shadows buried within his heart... (Profile 6\) Examples of Power Caster Xianzhong takes her zombie out on a walk. Saber senses it from across the town and tracks it down. He eats it for dinner and regains some mana, but also becomes a bit depressed. Praesente Medico Nihil Nocet Rank : EX *`In the presence of a doctor, no harm shall remain.`* --So goes the hymn of praise to the healer. Humanity once stumbled through the dark, ignorant of the structure of its own form. Only when countless bodies were laid open beneath a surgeon's blade did reason finally awake from its slumber. From those methodical dissections birthed the abstract yet tangible concept of `'man.'` Before the eyes of medicine, all `'man'` are born equal. In the pursuit of knowledge, no act is more noble than another. To reach the stars, one must first learn to lower their head and humbly cast their gaze to the ground. Only then will the path forward reveal itself. As the founder of modern anatomy, nothing is quite beneath Saber in his quest for truth. Which was exactly why he was able to chart a path no man dared dream before. In that regard, he stands as an undisputed *pioneer* within his domain. Effects Owing to the nature of his Class, Saber himself does not possess the ability to heal. Instead, all blessings of a restorative nature are delegated to his familiar, `Anguis.` Summoned alongside Saber, Anguis remains faithfully at his side at all times while carrying out its functions as the living embodiment of the medical arts. As long as Saber does not receive damage that directly acts upon his Spirit Core, Anguis is capable of restoring any injuries inflicted upon his body, including the destruction of vital organs such as the heart or brain. His physical form will always seek to knit itself back together and return to a pristine state, regardless of the severity of sustained trauma. Additionally, Anguis is able to merge with Saber's Secondary Noble Phantasm, `Non Omnis Moriar,` and imbue the weapons with additional effects. It is important to note that the location of Saber's Spirit Core is not fixed, nor is it easily identifiable without direct, close observation. It is not an endeavor as simple as striking the heart, or targeting any specific organ that *conventionally* acts as vital cores. To bring a definite end to Saber, one must uncover the true nature of his Core via conducting a meticulous 'autopsy', or completely exhaust him and shut down his healing via brute force. Limitations & Ruling Saber himself has no control over the healing process. It kicks in automatically the moment he is wounded and won't stop until the body has been fully restored, without any regard for Saber's wish or his mana reserves. A properly replenished Saber has enough mana for Anguis to fully regenerate his body from near-total destruction up to three times. Should it happen a fourth time, Saber must replenish his mana before the process starts or risk running out of mana and disappearing in the process. Examples of Power Saber eats Excalibrrrrr in the face and is reduced to a single bone. But wait\! Flesh and bones start growing from that bone until eventually, Saber becomes whole again. Sike\! Saber gets flattened by Heracles. He wants to play dead but no dice\! The healing kicks in immediately and heals him whole, causing Heracles to take notice of him and begins the flattening cycle anew.

# Char Creation Help

 \>\>\> Please keep this tab until your sheet has been approved\! \<\<\< Skill Restrictions \[edit\] Below is a list of skills that need special restrictions within the scope of Starry Night due to how easily they can be abused: Presence Concealment For Season 4.5 only, Presence Concealment will work the same as canon. Due to the mass-produced nature of S.E.R.V.A.N.T. frames, each model can be tracked by the company that produced them. There are only two ways for a Servant to be off the grid: either by leaving a nomadic city and keeping out of range of its surveillance, or having Presence Concealment in their arsenal. A Servant with Presence Concealment can hide the tracker in their Spirit Core from the system at their will. However, take caution, because any Servant that has gone offline for prolonged periods of time will be at risk for automatic deactivation by the system. Battle Continuation In order to keep fights fun for everyone involved, a Servant with any rank of Battle Continuation can only activate it once per Season. If you wish to use it multiple times in a Season, you'll have to provide enough justification and/or tweak the skill into something else with similar flavors that fits the Servant's legend.
